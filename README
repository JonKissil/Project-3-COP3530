These are the necessary files for using the gui

Make sure that within gui.cpp that the file path for builder.ui is changed within the activate() function. 
This file path is always relative to the exe, so for whatever config just make sure that the builder.ui file is in the appropriate file path 
for whatever is written in gui.cpp.

For making sure gtk works on desktop. First download and extract gtk4 from this --> https://github.com/wingtk/gvsbuild/releases/download/2024.11.1/GTK4_Gvsbuild_2024.11.1_x64.zip

Make a folder C:\gtk\
Put all the stuff from the unzip in here. For example, bin\ should look like C:\gtk\bin.

Next these three evniormental variables must be set

$env:Path = "C:\gtk\bin;" + $env:Path
$env:LIB = "C:\gtk\lib;" + $env:LIB
$env:INCLUDE = "C:\gtk\include;C:\gtk\include\cairo;C:\gtk\include\glib-2.0;C:\gtk\include\gobject-introspection-1.0;C:\gtk\lib\glib-2.0\include;" + $env:INCLUDE

These can be set by either just running this ^ in a powershell window in admin. This will only be a temporary setting and will reset when your computer restarts. 
A permanent fix is changing the enviorment variables. 
Search in windows "edit the system environment variables"
Open that window, make sure you are in advanced tab at the top and click "Enviorment variables..." at the bottom

If you have multiple users on ur pc just edit the system variables but it rlly doesnt matter. 

Select the "Path" Variabole and click edit; Click new and add your gtk bin directory as such: C:\gtk\bin
Click out of the path variable and stay in the systems variable.
Add a new variable and name it "LIB" and for its value add "C:\gtk\lib"
Next add another variable and name it "INCLUDE". Then add this as the value. "C:\gtk\include;C:\gtk\include\cairo;C:\gtk\include\glib-2.0;C:\gtk\include\gobject-introspection-1.0;C:\gtk\lib\glib-2.0\include;"

That should all be set for running the gui. Just make sure the cmake file is set up correctly to use all this.
